    "\n",
    "We have a rule for calculating the derivative of $x^{2}$ and the derivative of $sin(x)$, but how do we go about this example? This is where the __chain rule__ comes in.

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\times 1 =\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\times \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta u} \\times \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta x}$$\n",

If we know the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $u$ $(\\frac{dy}{du})$, and we know exactly how $u$ changes with respect to $x$ $(\\frac{du}{dx})$, we can use both rates of change to calculate the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.

Below we show an example with two intermediary variables:\n",
